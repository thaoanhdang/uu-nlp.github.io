## About Us

<img src="{{ 'assets/images/logo.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-thumbnail" alt="logo">

Welcome to the homepage of UU-NLP, the Natural Language Processing Group in the Department of Information and Computing Science at Utrecht University. We are a highly interdisciplinary team working on computational models of Natural Language, led by [Albert Gatt](https://albertgatt.github.io/). 

Our work centres around a number of core themes, including:
Models for automatic text generation and their evaluation;
Computational methods to study the relationship between [language and society](https://nlpsoc.github.io/);
Methods to model the interface between language and speech with other modalities, especially vision;
The challenges of [meaning variation](https://sites.google.com/view/dealingwithmeaningvariation/home) arising from subjective bias, ambiguity and vagueness.
In our research, we collaborate with a broad network of researchers, including colleagues in [Humanities](https://www.uu.nl/onderzoek/institute-for-language-sciences) and the [Social Sciences](https://nlp.sites.uu.nl/). [UU-NLP] forms part of [NLP@U](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/applied-data-science/special-interest-group-text-mining), the UU Joint Special Interest Group in Natural Language Processing.
